Based on the [Enchanted Book Extractor by yosho27](https://www.planetminecraft.com/mod/enchanted-book-extractor-datapack-1-14/)

## Details
Disenchanting is done on top of an enchanting table.
To start disenchanting an item, you will need the following:
- an amethyst shard
- a book
- lapis lazuli (for removing one enchantment) or one lapis block (for removing
all enchantments)

After gathering these items, throw them on top of an enchanting table. If all
of the required items are there, you will hear the disenchanting sound. If you
used a single lapis lazuli, the bottom-most enchantment will be moved from the
enchanted item to the book. If you used a lapis block, all of the enchantments
will be moved from the enchanted item to the book.
